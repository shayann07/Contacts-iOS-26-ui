# Contacts-iOS-26-UI

**Contacts‑iOS‑26‑UI** is a beautifully crafted Android contacts app inspired by the elegant, glassy UI of iOS 26.  This sample project demonstrates how to recreate a modern iOS‑style look and feel on Android while leveraging familiar Jetpack libraries and patterns.  Use it as a design reference or starting point for your own contacts manager.

## ✨ Features

- **Sleek, modern UI** – glassmorphic cards, pastel accents and smooth transitions reminiscent of iOS 26.
- **Contact management** – add, browse, search and organize your contacts with ease.
- **Favourites and profile photos** – star your favourite contacts and upload a profile image for each entry.
- **Persistent storage** – save your data locally using a Room/SQLite database; your contacts remain after closing the app.
- **Intuitive navigation** – bottom navigation and material design components guide users through the app naturally.
